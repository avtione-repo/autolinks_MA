abstract="In this paper, we present IdentiFinderTM, a hidden Markov model that learns to recognize and classify names, dates, times, and numerical quantities. We have evaluated the model in English (based on data from the Sixth and Seventh Message Understanding Conferences [MUC-6, MUC-7] and broadcast news) and in Spanish (based on data distributed through the First Multilingual Entity Task [MET-1]), and on speech input (based on broadcast news). We report results here on standard materials only to quantify performance on data available to the community, namely, MUC-6 and MET-1. Results have been consistently better than reported by any other learning algorithm. IdentiFinder's performance is competitive with approaches based on handcrafted rules on mixed case text and superior on text where case information is not available. We also present a controlled experiment showing the effect of training set size on performance, demonstrating that as little as 100,000 words of training data is adequate to get performance around 90{\%} on newswire. Although we present our understanding of why this algorithm performs so well on this class of problems, we believe that significant improvement in performance may still be possible.",

abstract="We present a new algorithm, called Nuage, for drawing graphs with both adjacency and inclusion relationships between nodes, that is, compound graphs. Compound graphs are more general than classical graph models or clustered graphs. Nuage can be applied to both directed and undirected compound graphs. It can be parameterized by classical graph drawing algorithms. Nuage can be viewed as a method for unifying several classical algorithms within the same drawing by using the structure of the compound graph. Additionally, we present a refinement technique that can be used in conjunction with Nuage to reduce the number of edge crossings.",
